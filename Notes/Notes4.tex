\section{Day 4: Finite Products, Product Topology and Projections}
\subsection{Finite Product and Product Topology}
First recall that the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product}{Cartesian Product} between two sets, $X,Y$ is defined to be
\[X\times Y=\{\langle x,y\rangle\vert x\in X,y\in Y\}\]
Then we further define the Product topology as follow,
\begin{definition}[Product Topology]
    Let $(X,\tau),(Y,\mu)$ be topological spaces, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology}{Product Topology} on $X\times Y$ is the topology generated by the basis
    \[\mathscr{B}=\{U\times V\vert U\in\tau\text{ and } V\in\mu\}\]    
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for a toplogy
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We first begin by proving that $\mathscr{B}$ covers $X\times Y$, let $\langle x,y\rangle\in X\times Y$ be arbitrary, we notice that $X\in\tau$ and $Y\in\mu$, so we have that $\langle x,y\rangle\in X\times Y\in\mathscr{B}$.

    Now let $B_1,B_2\in\mathscr{B}$, by definition we have $B_1=U_1\times V_1$ and $B_2 = U_2\times V_2$ for suitable sets. Let $\langle x,y\rangle\in(U_1\times V_1)\cap(U_2\times V_2)$. Then we notice that 
    \[\langle x,y\rangle\in(U_1\cap U_2)\times(V_1\cap V_2)\subseteq (U_1\times V_1)\cap(U_2\times V_2)\]
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    If $\mathscr{B}$ and $\mathscr{S}$ are bases for $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then the set 
    \[\mathscr{D} = \{B\times C\vert B\in\mathscr{B},C\in\mathscr{S}\}\]
    is a basis for the product topology
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We wish to show that it indeed is a basis, and that it does generate the product topology.

    We begin by showing that it covers. Let $\langle x,y\rangle\in X\times Y$ be arbitrary, we then notice two things
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for $X$, there exists $B\in\mathscr{B}$ such that $x\in B$
        \item Since $\mathscr{S}$ is a basis for $Y$, there exists $S\in\mathscr{S}$ such that $y\in S$
    \end{enumerate}
    So we have $\langle x,y\rangle\in B\times S\in\mathscr{D}$

    Further let $B_1\times C_1,B_2\times C_2\in\mathscr{D}$, let $\langle x,y\rangle\in(B_1\times C_1)\cap(B_2\times C_2)$. Notice that since $B_1$ and $B_2$ belong to the same topological space, and that $x$ exists in their intersection, we have the existence of some $B_3\in\mathscr{B}$ such that $x\in B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$. We may similarly conclude the existence of a $C_3$. Thus we have
    \[\langle x,y\rangle\in B_3\times C_3\subseteq (B_1\times C_1)\cap(B_2\times C_2)\]

    Now that we have shown that $\mathscr{D}$ is indeed a bases, we are left to show that it generates the product topology. Let $U\in X$ and $V\in Y$ be open. We may rewrite them as
    \begin{center}
        $U = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}B_\alpha, B_\alpha\in\mathscr{B}$ and $V = \bigcup_{\gamma\in\Pi}C_\gamma, C_\gamma\in\mathscr{S}$

    \end{center}
    Thus it follows That
    \begin{align*}
        U\times V &= \bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}B_\alpha\times \bigcup_{\gamma\in\Pi}C_\gamma\\
        &= \bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda,\gamma\in\Pi}B_\alpha\times C_\gamma
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 4.3 basically say that we can mix and match topologies and bases. An example of this is the plane
\begin{example}[The Plane]
    Given $\mathbb{R}^2=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ with each copy of the real line endowed with the usual topology, we have that the topology of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is generated by open rectangles.
\end{example}
\subsection{Projections}
\begin{definition}[Projection]

    The functions $\pi_1:X\times Y\surjto\footnote{This arrow is to symbolize that the function is surjective} X$ and $\pi_2:X\times Y\surjto Y$ are given by
    \begin{align*}
        \pi_1\langle x,y\rangle = x &&\pi_2\langle x,y\rangle = y
    \end{align*}
    are called the projections of $X\times Y$ onto $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    Given topological spaces, $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\mu)$, the collection
    \[\mathscr{S}=\{\pi_1^{-1}(U),\pi_2^{-1}(V)\vert U\in X, V\in Y\}\]
    form a subbases for the product topology on $X\times Y$
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
    The pre-image of $U$ and $V$ are actually elements of $X\times Y$, this kinda confused me in lecture.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
    We begin by showing covering, we first notice that the preimage of $X$ is necessarily $X\times Y$, thus we have covering.

    Now to show that $\mathscr{S}$ does generate the product topology. Let $U\in\tau,V\in\mu$, we want to express $U\times V$ as a finite intersection of elements of $\mathscr{S}$. So we may notice that
    \[U\times V = \pi_1^{-1}(U)\cap \pi_2^{-1}(V)\]
\end{proof}
