\section{Day 10 : Boxs,Products and Being Metrizeable}
\subsection{Comparing Boxes, Uniforms and Produts}
Recall that we have 3 easily define 3, the Product, Uniform and Box topologies. And in general we have the following containments
\[\tau_{Product}\subseteq\tau_{Uniform}\subseteq\tau_{Box}\]
\begin{remark}
    The Box topology is sometimes Metrizeable
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is not discrete, then $X_{\square}^\Lambda$ is not metrizeable
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Write Proof
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    The countable product of metrizable spaces is metrizable
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Write Proof
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    $\{0,1\}^\Lambda$ is not metrizable if $\Lambda$ is uncountable
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Write Proof
\end{proof}
